        I have over 9 years of experience in the banking and finance industries.
        Iâ€™ve always enjoyed working in helping people finding the most suitable
        solutions for their needs. I started learning how to code with data
        analysis in mind. However, the innate problem-solving nature of it,
        along with the endless possibilities of what one can accomplish with a
        programming language, ranging from a groundbreaking app to a simple tool
        to improve efficiency in a specific task, compelled me to pursue a
        career change towards a web developer role.
